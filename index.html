      "NSG Ameshorst":"The designation as a nature reserve is made in accordance with Section 20 of the North Rhine-Westphalia Nature Conservation Act (LG NRW), in particular for the preservation of communities and biotopes of certain wild animal and plant species. The following are considered communities and habitats in particular: oak-hornbeam forest, woodrush-beech forest – due to the special character and outstanding beauty of this landscape feature, and for the preservation of old-growth trees. Explanation: The forest nature reserve is dominated by pedunculate oak-hornbeam forests of varying types. In smaller plots on nutrient-poor sites, there are occasional acidic oak forests and woodrush-beech forests. In some places, the forest exhibits aspects of historical coppicing practices. The southern part of the forest, which comprises about one-third of the Ameshorst area, is particularly distinguished by its excellent combination of species typical of the respective oak forests. The long period of undisturbed development of the forest has contributed significantly to this characteristic. The dominant feature of the overall character is the pedunculate oak-hornbeam forest (FFH code 9160) described in the Habitats Directive, whose herbaceous layer is dominated by, among other species, wood sorrel, greater stitchwort, and honeysuckle. Subordinate habitats include the fragmented woodrush-beech forest with lesser bracken, bracken, and Polytrichum formosum (FFH code 9110) and the acidic oak forest (FFH code 9190). This impoverished forest community mainly consists of sedges, purple moor grass, raspberry, and bracken.
